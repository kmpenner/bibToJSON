# bibToJSON
converts standard printed bibliography entries into JSON CSL importable by Zotero
# Instructions
Paste something like the following in the left box:

Adolf Neubauer, “The Hebrew Bible in Shorthand Writing,” jqr 7.2 (1895): 361–364.

And then click the Convert button.

If the script recognizes the input as a well-formed citation, it will remove the recognized text from the left box and copy its equivalent JSON to the clipboard, ready to import into Zotero using Ctrl-Alt-Shift-i

The left box will retain any unrecognized text, which you can then edit and try the Convert button again.
